        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname “Mad River.”
            The first rubber raft was made by Lt. John Fremont and Horace H. Day believed to be built it the 1840s. They planned to survey the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Although invented back then, it was not until the turn of the century that the first commercial rafting trip took place. On June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon. In later years, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. constructed a modern resort hotel in Grand Teton National Park. In the late 1950s the lodge began offering float trips. They used surplus war rafts that were 8 ft wide by 27 ft long. Less than 500 people went that year but the demand started increasing. It was not until the 1960s and 70s that whitewater rafting companies started forming. In the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, whitewater rafting was included for the first time. Now whitewater rafting has risen
            to a popular sport and hobby, growing more and more every year.

            During the turn of the century, a new type of business sprung up in the Lehigh Gorge. A resort was built in Jim Thorpe along the Lehigh River. The 47 room Hotel Wahnetah was a perfect getaway for people in Northeastern United States. The hotel prided itself on the beautiful hike to the Glen Onoko falls which became nearly as popular as Niagara Falls at the time. Unfortunately, the beauty of the hotel was short- lived. In 1911 it burned down in a major forest fire. The falls and their beauty still remain there and can be seen on hikes through this area. There are even remains of stone steps and foundations of old buildings.

After lots of devastation, fires and the end of the coal era, the Lehigh Gorge was nearly forgotten. It was not until the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the railroad trail in the 1970s that the area became popular again. The tracks were eventually taken out and became a scenic bicycling path. In 1980 the area became known at the Lehigh Gorge State Park.

Above the Lehigh Gorge State Park is a significant structure that helps in the conservation of this beautiful park. The Francis E. Walter Dam in White Haven was built in 1961 and it has prevented millions of dollars in flood damage in the areas below it. The dam has also been a tremendous help for recreational whitewater industry on the Lehigh River but it wass not until 1988 that the purpose of the dam was expanded to include both flood control and recreation. It was still a guessing game for many more years. Boaters and fishermen never knew when a release would take place.

Finally, in 2005, it was realized that great benefits would be gained if water was stored in the spring and released in the summer. Scheduled dam releases now took place and trips could be planned easier and safer. Whitewater rafting is now an icon and loved by many on the Lehigh Gorge!
